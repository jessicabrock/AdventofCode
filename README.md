# AdventofCode

2020 holiday challege. Up to 50 gold coins in the challenge. I won't 
get to 50, but let's see how far I get.

## File Structure

Looks like each day has two challenges. So I created subdirectories for
each day and part.

AdventofCode
- day1_part1 
-- instructions.txt (from AdventofCode website)
-- day1_part1.py (code file)
-- input.txt (data input, from AdventofCode website)
-- test.py (optional, pytest or doctest)
